# Car-Details-Analysis
Contains a comprehensive analysis of a used car dataset from CarDekho, focusing on pricing trends, mileage insights, and ownership patterns. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to understand key factors influencing resale value.

📌 Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing outliers, and preparing the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between car attributes such as price, mileage, year, and fuel type.
Outlier Detection & Removal: Using box plots and quantile filtering to refine data quality.
Correlation & Trend Analysis: Understanding key price drivers using heatmaps and scatter plots.
3D & Interactive Plots: Employing Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for enhanced insights.
🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly (Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (For future price prediction models)
📊 Insights:
The selling price of a car is influenced by year, fuel type, and ownership status.
Higher kilometers driven generally lead to lower resale value.
Automatic transmission cars tend to have a different pricing trend than manual ones.
🚀 Future Scope:
Implementing machine learning models to predict resale value.
Enhancing interactive dashboards for better visualization.
